* I created the tables for the events microservice in the postgres database

I spent nearly the whole day trying to figure out how the tables connect to the database. I had help from multiple SEIRs (Chad was really helpful!) and my whole team because we did not have adequete information on how to set up the multiple postgres databases and link them with our files that create the tables. I wish we would just focus on the way we are suppose to be structuring our files and writing them it in lectures instead have them set up differently in every lecture.

I was eventually able to get my migrations working and the tables showing up in pg-admin once I figured out how to write the DATABASE_URL in the docker compose and once Conner let me know the difference command I had to use for the docker compose build.

* I created a excalidraw of the events relational database at the 3 form of mormalization

I went over my excalidraw with the team to make sure it all looked correct.

I used the rest of my time to research and better understand how joining tables in sequel actually works and on the exploration. I feel like I definitely havea better understand of their functionality and use cases
