Today I worked on:
* Cloning down the GitLab repo and going through the previous exploration

While the other teammates worked on the third form normalized tables, I went back and tried to get a better understanding of how these table relationships work in Postgres.

Today i worked on:
* Going over foodies.sql example to better understand the file structure
* Researched authentication with JWTdown for FastAPI

I wanted to understand how to create endpoints for Login and Logout functionality for users and how tokens will be used to give permission or lack-there-of for the various microservices and features within them. Once the postgres is set up and models are being created I will be able to start implementing the code to offer these permissions.
