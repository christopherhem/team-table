## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

## SAMPLE JOURNAL FORMAT
+ The date of the entry

+ A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable

+ A reflection on any design conversations that you had

+ At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small




## July 9, 2021

Today, I worked on:

* Getting a customer's data for the account page
  with Asa

Asa and I wrote some SQL. We tested it out with
Insomnia and the UI. We had to coordinate with
Petra who was working on the GHI with Azami.

Today, I found the F2/Rename symbol functionality
in Visual Studio Code! It allows me to rename a
variable without causing bugs. I am going to be
using this a lot!
