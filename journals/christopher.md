Today, I worked on:

Organizing and getting files from the startup-repo into our git repository. I also tested and ensured they were properly configured for development on both Mac and Windows. 

Afterwards we then divided and tried to conquer some issues on the git board. I ended up selecting the User microservice and made an attempt to ensure it was in third transitive form before building the api and database. Once completed, the exploration part on third form made slightly more sense. 

I will have to continue to reference back to the explorations when building this Postgres database. However, I feel confident enough to get it started and tackle this issue. Also, I have a very supportive and knowledgeable team to help me as well.

A slightly stressful day for me. I had some family medical emergencies come up and was having a difficult time focusing. Luckily I was able to re-gain focus and take care Users microservice database connecting it to the rest of the application. I will still need to review all about Postgres once more, it's still a bit cloudy in my mind and having trouble seeing the flow of all things and how they will come together. A bit nervous about learning MongoDB soon because I'm barely getting a grasp on Postgres. Until then... code on.
