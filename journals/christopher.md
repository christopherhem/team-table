Today, I worked on:

Organizing and getting files from the startup-repo into our git repository. I also tested and ensured they were properly configured for development on both Mac and Windows. 

Afterwards we then divided and tried to conquer some issues on the git board. I ended up selecting the User microservice and made an attempt to ensure it was in third transitive form before building the api and database. Once completed, the exploration part on third form made slightly more sense. 

I will have to continue to reference back to the explorations when building this Postgres database. However, I feel confident enough to get it started and tackle this issue. Also, I have a very supportive and knowledgeable team to help me as well.
