# Introduction to TeamTable
TeamTable is a team management app designed to help members of large teams coordinate and plan for shift swaps and shift covers. Members of a team can post their needed shift swaps and the times they are available to cover a shift in return and the system can automatically find shift swaps or people willing to cover their shift if they exist. Members can also post cover events which allow them to cover other peoples shifts for the purpose of getting more hours. If a users shift is covered in this way then their availability is automatically turned into a cover event so that they can "pay it forward" and help someone else get the time off they need.

## User Dashboard
The user dashboard displays the users posted shift swap requests and cover availabilities as well as notifications informing them if one of their shifts has been covered which includes the dates and times they will need to cover in return. Users can be a member of multiple teams (such as the popular imaginary fast food chains, Burger Monarch and McDimwalds), and the events will not interact with one another. For example, a user could not pick up a shift at Burgur Monarch in exchange for a shift at McDimwalds. 

## Team Dashboard
The team dashboard displays the information for an individual team, including all the requested swaps on the team, members, and roles. This allows users to view a team dashboard and see shifts they might be interested in picking up, they can then post an availability during that time and request the swap.
